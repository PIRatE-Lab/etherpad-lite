1.	What specific technological tools are you using now, and which ones would you use next year if you are Director?

2.	Tell us something we might not know about a technology relevant to our soon-to-be center.

3.	As a start-up center in a start-up university, this position is going to require great input and time commitments (at least in the early years).  How would you accommodate these unusual needs along with your other obligations and interests?
4.	Librarians have a real tradition of service here at CI, such as offering extended hours during finals.  How do you feel about Library service and what kinds of service beyond the library might you participate in?  What type of institutional service have you engaged in at your current university?
5.	We’re a student-centered university.  What examples can you give for your own student-centered approach?  
6.	Would you want to continue in the tradition of the director participating in holistic team grading with the First Year Composition Team?
7.	How would you address the needs of our particular student populations, including Hispanic students, distance learners, students who work full-time, veterans, and the underprepared?  You don’t have to address each one, just give us a couple of examples.
